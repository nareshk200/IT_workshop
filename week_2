Grep command in Unix:
The grep command in Unix/Linux is a powerful tool used for searching and
manipulating text patterns within files. Its name is derived from the ed (editor)
command g/re/p (globally search for a regular expression and print matching
lines), which reflects its core functionality. grep is widely used by
programmers, system administrators, and users alike for its efficiency and
versatility in handling text data. In this article, we will explore the various
aspects of the grep command.
-c: This prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern
-h: Display the matched lines, but do not display the filenames.
-l: Displays list of a filenames only.
-n: Display the matched lines and their line numbers.
-v: This prints out all the lines that do not matches the pattern
-e : Specifies expression with this option. Can use multiple times.
-o :Print only the matched parts of a matching line, with each such part on a
separate output line.

Sed Command in Unix:
•
•
SED is a powerful text stream editor. Can do insertion, deletion,
search and replace(substitution).
SED command in unix supports regular expression which allows it
perform complex pattern matching.
Example:
Consider the below text file as an input.
$cat > geekfile.txt
unix is great os. unix is opensource. unix is free os.
learn operating system.
unix linux which one you choose.
unix is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a
powerful.
Replacing or substituting string : Sed command is mostly used to
replace the text in a file. The below simple sed command replaces the
word “unix” with “linux” in the file.
$sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
Output :
2|Pagelinux is great os. unix is opensource. unix is free os.
learn operating system.
linux which one you choose.
linux is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a
powerful.
Here the “s” specifies the substitution operation. The “/” are
delimiters. The “unix” is the search pattern and the “linux” is the
replacement string.
By default, the sed command replaces the first occurrence of the
pattern in each line and it won’t replace the second,
third…occurrence in the line.
Example:
Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line :
Use the /1, /2 etc flags to replace the first, second occurrence of a
pattern in a line. The below command replaces the second
occurrence of the word “unix” with “linux” in a line.
$sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt
Output:
unix is great os. linux is opensource. unix is free os.
learn operating system.
unix linux which one you choose.
unix is easy to learn.linux is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a
powerful.
Try it:
Sed ‘s/hello/HELLO/g’ file1.txt
Sed ‘2 s/hello/HELLO/2g’ file1.txt
Sed ‘2d’ file1.txt : removing second line of the paragraph
3|PageSed ‘2,4d’ file1.txt : removing second line and 4 th line of the
paragraph
Sed ‘/core/d’ file1.txt : removing the total line of the core
$ sed '$d' file1.txt
$sed '2,$ s/unix/linux/' file1.txt
$sed 's/unix/linux/p' file1.txt
Sort Command:
In Unix-based operating systems, the sort command is used to sort
the lines of a text file or input stream. It's a versatile command with
various options to customize the sorting behavior.
Uses of sort command:
1. It can sort any type of file be it table file text file numeric file
and so on.
2. Sorting can be directly implemented from one file to another
without the present work being hampered.
3. Sorting of table files on the basis of columns has been made
way simpler and easier.
4. So many options are available for sorting in all possible ways.
5. The most beneficial use is that a particular data file can be used
many times as no change is made in the input file provided.

output:
Try it:
-o: Specifies an output file for the sorted data.
Functionally equivalent to redirecting output to a file.
-r: Sorts data in reverse order (descending).
-n: Sorts a file numerically (interprets data as numbers).
-nr: Sorts a file with numeric data in reverse order.
Combines -n and -r options.
-k: Sorts a table based on a specific column number.
-c: Checks if the file is already sorted and reports any
disorder.
5|Page-u: Sorts and removes duplicate lines, providing a unique
sorted list.
-M: Sorts by month names.
chmod Command:
In Unix operating systems, the chmod command is used to change
the access mode of a file. The name is an abbreviation of change
mode. Which states that every file and directory has a set of
permissions that control the permissions like who can read, write or
execute the file. In this the permissions have three categories: read,
write, and execute simultaneously represented by `r`, `w` and `x`.
These letters combine together to form a specific permission for a
group of users.
The `chmod` command is used to modify this permission so that it
can grant or restrict access to directories and files. Let’s have a look
at the syntax and options for the `chmod` command in Linux
Operating System.
The following operators can be used with the symbolic mode:
Operators

AWK command in Unix:
awk is a powerful text processing tool available in Unix and Unix-
like operating systems. It is particularly useful for processing
structured text files, such as CSV files or log files. awk operates on a
line-by-line basis, processing each line of input according to the
specified commands. Here are some common awk commands and
their usage:
Example:
Consider the following text file as the input file for all cases below:
$cat > employee.txt
ajay manager account 45000
sunil clerk account 25000
varun manager sales 50000
amit manager account 47000
tarun peon sales 15000
deepak clerk sales 23000
sunil peon sales 13000
8|Pagesatvik director purchase 80000
Print the lines which match the given pattern.
$ awk '/manager/ {print}' employee.txt
Output:
ajay manager account 45000
varun manager sales 50000
amit manager account 47000
try it:
Splitting a Line Into Fields : For each record i.e line, the awk
command splits the record delimited by whitespace character by
default and stores it in the $n variables. If the line has 4 words, it
will be stored in $1, $2, $3 and $4 respectively. Also, $0 represents
the whole line.
$ awk '{print $1,$4}' employee.txt
• Use of NR built-in variables (Display Line Number)
$ awk '{print NR,$0}' employee.txt
• To return the second column/item from file1.txt:
$ awk '{print $2}' file1.txt
• To count the lines in a file:
$ awk '{ print NR }' file.txt
9|Pageawk free -M
• awk ‘/Mem/{print}/’ free -m
• awk ‘NR==2{printNR,$0}’ free -m
shutdown command:
The shutdown command in Linux is used to shutdown the system in
a safe way. You can shutdown the machine immediately, or schedule
a shutdown using 24 hour format.It brings the system down in a
secure way. When the shutdown is initiated, all logged-in users and
processes are notified that the system is going down, and no further
logins are allowed.
shutdown [options] [time] [message]
shutdown -r +5 reboot
options – Shutdown options such as halt, power-off (the default
option) or reboot the system.
time – The time argument specifies when to perform the shutdown
process.
message – The message argument specifies a message which will be
broadcast to all users.
Examples:
$ shutdown -H
$shutdown -P
$ shutdown -r now
$ shutdown -r +5
$ sudo shutdown 15:00
$ sudo shutdown +10
10 | P a g e$ sudo shutdown -c
Options: try it:
r : Requests that the system be rebooted after it has been brought
down.
-h : Requests that the system be either halted or powered off after it
has been brought down, with the choice as to which left up to the
system.
-H : Requests that the system be halted after it has been brought
down.
-P : Requests that the system be powered off after it has been
brought down.
-c : Cancels a running shutdown. TIME is not specified with this
option, the first argument is MESSAGE.
-k : Only send out the warning messages and disable logins, do not
actually bring the system down.
SSH :
SSH, or Secure Shell, constitutes a cryptographic network protocol
designed to enable secure communication between two systems over
networks that may not be secure. This protocol is widely employed
for remote access to servers and the secure transmission of files
between computers. In essence, SSH acts as a secure conduit,
establishing a confidential channel for communication in scenarios
where the network may pose security risks. This technology is
instrumental for professionals seeking a reliable and secure method
of managing servers and transferring sensitive data across
computers in a controlled and protected manner. ssh runs at
TCP/IP port 22.
ssh [username]@[hostname or IP address
11 | P a g eReplace [username] with your remote server username, and
[hostname or IP address] with the server’s hostname or IP address.
Install SSH Component on Linux
Setting up SSH on Linux may be necessary, as some distributions
don’t come with it pre-installed. Installing OpenSSH, a widely used
SSH implementation, or opting for a graphical user interface (GUI)
solution like the PuTTY client for Ubuntu can address this. Here’s a
step-by-step guide on installing and configuring OpenSSH on both
the client and server sides:
sudo yum install openssh-clients openssh-server
• This command is used to connect to a remote server.
ssh [username]@[hostname or IP address]
ex:
ssh user@example.com
• ssh-copy-id: This command is used to copy your SSH public
key to a remote server's authorized_keys file, enabling
passwordless SSH login.
ssh-copy-id [username]@[hostname or IP address]
ex:
ssh-copy-id user@example.com
• ssh-add: This command is used to add private key identities to
the SSH authentication agent.
ssh-add [path to private key]
ex:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
• This command connects to the remote server using port 2222.
Adjust the port number as needed
ssh -p 2222 username@remote_server_ip
12 | P a g ecommand consists of 3 different parts:
➢ ssh command instructs the system to establish an encrypted
secure connection with the host machine.
➢ user_name represents the account that is being accessed on the
host.
➢ host refers to the machine which can be a computer or a router
that is being accessed. It can be an IP address (e.g.,
192.168.1.24) or domain e.g., www.domainname.com).
The three major encryption techniques used by SSH are:
• Symmetrical encryption
• Asymmetrical encryption
• Hashing

13 | P a g eFTP:
File transfer protocol (FTP) is an Internet tool provided by TCP/IP.
The first feature of FTP is developed by Abhay Bhushan in 1971. It
helps to transfer files from one computer to another by providing
access to directories or folders on remote computers and allows
software, data, text file to be transferred between different kinds of
computers. The end-user in the connection is known as localhost and
the server which provides data is known as the remote host.
FTP Clients
FTP works on a client-server model. The FTP client is a program
that runs on the user’s computer to enable the user to talk to and get
files from remote computers. It is a set of commands that establishes
the connection between two hosts, helps to transfer the files, and
then closes the connection. Some of the commands are: get
filename(retrieve the file from server), mget filename(retrieve
multiple files from the server ), ls(lists files available in the current
directory of the server). There are also built-in FTP programs,
which makes it easier to transfer files and it does not require
remembering the commands.
Type of FTP Connections
FTP connections are of two types:
Active FTP connection: In an Active FTP connection, the client
establishes the command channel and the server establishes the data
channel. When the client requests the data over the connection the
server initiates the transfer of the data to the client. It is not the
default connection because it may cause problems if there is a
firewall in between the client and the server.
Passive FTP connection: In a Passive FTP connection, the client
establishes both the data channel as well as the command channel.
When the client requests the data over the connection, the server
sends a random port number to the client, as soon as the client
receives this port number it establishes the data channel. It is the
14 | P a g edefault connection, as it works better even if the client is protected
by the firewall.
When an FTP connection is established, there are two types of
communication channels are also established and they are known as
command channel and data channel. The command channel is used
to transfer the commands and responses from client to server and
server to client. FTP uses the same approach as TELNET or SMTP
to communicate across the control connection. It uses the NVT
ASCII character set for communication. It uses port number 21.
Whereas the data channel is used to actually transfer the data
between client and server. It uses port number 20.

Service:
Linux operating systems are known for their robustness and
versatility, and managing system services is a crucial aspect of
maintaining a well-functioning system. With the advent of systemd,
a system and service manager for Linux operating systems, the
systemctl command has become an essential tool for managing
services. In this article, we will explore the intricacies of systemctl
and how it can be used to control and monitor system services.
Starting and Stopping Services
systemctl start [service]
• Enabling Services
systemctl enable [service]
If we want to enable our firewall service.
systemctl enable firewalld
• Disabling Services
systemctl disable [service]
If we want to disable our firewall service.
systemctl disable firewalld
Restarting and Reloading Services
• Restarting Services
systemctl restart [service]
If we want to restart our SSH service.
16 | P a g esystemctl restart sshd
• Reloading Services
systemctl reload [service]
If we want to reload our Apache service.
systemctl reload httpd
chown Command
the Linux operating system, file ownership is a crucial aspect of
system security and user management. The `chown` command,
short for “change owner,” is a powerful tool that allows users to
change the owner of files and directories. This command is
particularly useful in scenarios where administrators need to grant
or revoke access to specific resources. In this article, we will explore
the fundamentals of file ownership in Linux and delve into the usage
of the chown command.
•
•
Root User: It is a superuser who has access to all the
directories and files in our system and it can perform any
operation. An important thing to note is that only the root user
can perform changing of permissions or ownerships of the files
that are not owned by them.
Regular User: These users have limited access to files and
directories and can only modify the files that they own.
Ownership and Permissions:
To protect and secure files and directories in Linux we use
permissions to control what a user can do with a file or directory.
Linux uses three types of permissions:
17 | P a g eRead: This permission allows the user to read files in directories, it
lets the user read directories and subdirectories stored in it.
Write: This permission allows a user to modify and delete a file.
Also, it allows a user to modify its contents (create, delete, and
rename files in it) for the directories. Unless the execution
permission is given to directories changes do affect them.
Execute This permission on a file allows it to get executed. For
example, if we have a file named php.sh unless we don’t give it
execute permission it won’t run.
Here’s a breakdown of the components:
Here’s a breakdown of the components:
`chown`: The base command.
`options`: Optional flags that modify the behavior of the
`chown` command.
`new_owner[:new_group]`: The new owner and optionally
the new group. If `new_group` is omitted, only the owner is
changed.
Here’s a breakdown of the components:
How to File Ownership in Linux
To Change the owner of a file in Linux, you can use the following
basic syntax:
chown owner_name file_name
chown master file1.txt
To change the group ownership of a file, utilize the following syntax:
chown :group1 file1.t
